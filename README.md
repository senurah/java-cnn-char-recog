# Character Recognition Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Java 

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for character recognition in Java. It was developed to practice and gain an understanding of CNNs.

## Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset for handwritten digits by default. You can download it from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Place the dataset in the `data` directory.

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the YouTube video series "Character Recognition with CNN in Java" by [Rae is Online](https://www.youtube.com/channel/raeisonline7254). Special thanks to the channel for the valuable tutorials that helped in understanding CNN concepts.
